# Evaluating OpenAI's Whisper for Robustness with 'In The Wild' Datasets
We are evaluating [OpenAI's whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) under 'in the wild' datasets using the WER metric to understand its robustness. The aim is to see if Whisper can be used as an additional feature to Mobile X Lab's VeriLight system by focusing on hashing live speech transcriptions as an additional form of verification to VeriLight's visual detection system.
